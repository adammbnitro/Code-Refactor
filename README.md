# Code Refactor

![Alt text](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/seo-concept.jpg)

## Description: 

I built this project to improve the accessibility standards of the marketing agency, Horiseon, through the addition of semantic HTML and alt attributes. I also reviewed the code, removing any unneccessary tags or elements for maximum efficiency and easier readability for developers, as well as refining the title of the webpage that appears on the browser tab. Altogether, this enhances the ranking of the site for search engines and decreases advertising costs for the company as a result.

I have added comments in the CSS file above every CSS rule for the benefit of understanding each code refactor.
